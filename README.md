Alzheimer's Detection Using EEG Signals
🧠 Predicting Alzheimer's disease using EEG data with Machine Learning.

📌 Overview
This project focuses on using EEG (Electroencephalography) signals to predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
By analyzing EEG patterns, we apply machine learning models to classify patients as AD or Healthy, achieving a measurable accuracy.

📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of EEG signals collected from individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's and healthy controls.
🔹 Data Source: [https://osf.io/2v5md/]
🔹 Preprocessing: Applied noise filtering, normalization, and feature extraction.

🛠️ Technologies Used
✅ Programming Language: Python
✅ Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📈 Results
Model Accuracy: 92%
